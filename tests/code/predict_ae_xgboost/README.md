## Autoencoder + XGBoost Prediction Test

# Introduction

This test demonstrates how to load a saved autoencoder + xgboost model, use it to make predictions for a sample dataset and save images with the model's prediction next to the labeling tool's automatic annotation.

# Usage

1. Activate conda environment in the terminal
2. Navigate to the folder `predict_ae_xgboost`
3. Run `python main.py` in the terminal
4. Explore the folder `results` generated in the root directory of the repository.
